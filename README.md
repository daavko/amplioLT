# AmplioLT

A modified version of [AmplioLT by hugomflavio](https://github.com/hugomflavio/amplioLT) with some extra tweaks cobbled together from various other sources. Most notable are health bars ~~stolen~~ borrowed from [RoundSquare](https://github.com/HansLemurson/RoundSquare)

## Differences between this and regular Hexemplio

- Unit, building, and wonder graphics for the LTT ruleset (it's compatible with an older version of LTX as well, but I didn't bother adding new LTX buildings yet)
- Better unit HP bar
- Several other small things
